## Syntax 
To generate the client/server C stubs from the interface defined in the .x file, run

```
rpcgen -C <interface>.x
```

## Generated Codes

The outcome of this operation generates several files.

1. `<interface>.h` contains all of the language specific definitions of the datatypes and the function prototypes.
2. `<interface>_svc.c` contains the code for the server side stub 
	- The first part of `<interface>_svc.c` contains the `main` function for the server which includes code for the registration step and also some additional housekeeping operations.
	- The second part contains all of the code that is related to the particular RPC service. This code handles request parsing and argument marshaling.
	- In addition, the autogenerated code will include the prototype for the actual procedure that is invoked in the server process. This has to be implemented by the developer.
3. `<interface>_clnt.c` contains the code for the client side stub.
	- The client stub will include a procedure that is automatically generated and this will represent a wrapper for the actual RPC call that the client makes to the server-side process.

-> Once we have this, the developer can just call the function.
4. The compilation steps also generates `<interface>_xdr.c` which contains code for marshaling/unmarshalling routines that will be used by both the client and the server.
