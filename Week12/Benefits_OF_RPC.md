- RPC is intended to simplify the development of interactions across address spaces and machines.
- One benefit of RPC is that it offers a high-level interface for data movement and communication. This means that the developer can focus more on what their application does as opposed to the standard boilerplate setup.

RPC also handles a lot of the errors that may arise from low-level communication/transmission interactions, freeing the developer from having to explicitly re-implement error handling in each program.

Finally, RPC hides complexities of cross-machine interactions.
