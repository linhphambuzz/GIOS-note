The binding process is initiated by the client using the following operation

```
CLIENT* clnt_create(char* host, unsigned long prog, unsigned long vers, char* proto);
```

For the `SQUARE_PROG` service we created above, the call would look like

```
CLIENT* clnt_handle;
clnt_handle = clnt_create(rpc_host_name, SQUARE_PROG, SQUARE_VERS, "tcp");
```

If there is a version changes, it has to be substituted in the handle call accordingly

`SQUARE_PROG` and `SQUARE_VERS` are autogenerated from the compilation of the XDR file and will be included in header file as `#define`'d values.

The return from this function is the client handle that will be used in every subsequent RPC call. This handle can also be used to track the status of the current request, as well as handle any error messages or authentication related information.
