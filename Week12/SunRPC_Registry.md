## Port mapper 

The code that the server needs in order to register with the registry is autogenerated as part of the `rpcgen` compilation step.

In SunRPC, the registry process runs on every machine, and is called **portmapper**. To start this process on Linux, run

```
sudo /sbin/portmap
```

This is the process that needs to be contacted both by the server when it wishes to register its service, and by the client when it needs to find the specific contact information for a given service.

Once the RPC daemon is running, we can check the services that are running with it using

```
/usr/sbin/rpcinfo -p
```

This command will return the **program id, version, protocol, socket port number, and service name** for every service running on that machine.

Portmapper itself is registered with both TCP and UDP protocols on socket 111.= so that clients using either of the protocol can call to the service.
