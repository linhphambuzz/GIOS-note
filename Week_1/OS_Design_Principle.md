### Separation of mechanism and policy 
- Flexible mechanisms to support many policies (LRU, ;FU, random)


### Optimize for common case 

- how os will be used, what will the user want to execute on that machine?
- what are are the workload requirements? 
-> pick a policy that makes sense given the mechanism and the abstraction the OS supports
