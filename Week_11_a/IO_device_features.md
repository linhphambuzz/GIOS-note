- The device space is extremely diverse.
- Devices come in all shapes and sizes with a lot of variability in their hardware architecture, functionality, and interfaces.
## Key features

### Control registers 
- set of control registers which can be accessed by the CPU and permit CPU/device interactions
1. **command registers**, that the CPU uses to control the device
2. **data registers**, that are used by the CPU to transfer data in and out of the device;
3. **status registers** that are used by the CPU to understand what is happening on the device.


Internally, the device will incorporate all other device-specific logic
### Microcontroler 
This will include the **microcontroller** - which is basically the device's CPU - on device memory, as well as any other logic needed by the device. 

## Ondevice memory, processing logics 
- interacting network with physical medium 
For example, some devices may need chips for converting analog to digital signals. As another example, network devices may need chips to interact with the physical network medium, be it optics or copper wire.
