There isn't really a straightforward answer to this question or the more general question of "Is X Useful?". The answer depends on which metrics we have gathered, as well as the workload on the system. For different combinations of these two variables, we may arrive at very different conclusions.

For example, some graph traversal algorithms work best on sparse graphs, while others work best on dense graphs. Some filesystems are optimized for read access, while others might be optimized for a write-heavy system.

The answer is: It depends! While, this answer is almost always correct, it is rarely accepted. What is more important perhaps, is to modify the question, extending it to include the context you wish to examine and the metrics you wish to obtain.
