## Consolidation
- Virtualization enables **consolidation**. Consolidation refers to the ability to run multiple VMs on a single physical platform. Consolidation leads to fewer machines, with less space, with fewer admins, with potentially smaller electric bills that are still able to run the same degree/type of workload.
- Consolidation allows us to decrease cost and improve manageability.

## Migration 
- Virtualization also makes **migration** easier. Since the operating system and the applications are no longer coupled to the physical system, virtualization makes it easy to setup, teardown, and clone virtual machines.

- Virtualization helps us address **availability** and **reliability**. If we notice that a physical machine is about to go down, we can easily spin up new VMs on a different physical platform.
- Because the OS and the applications are nicely encapsulated in a VM, it becomes easier to contain bugs or malicious code to those isolated containers without bringing down other VMs or the entire physical platform.

Virtualization has also provided fertile ground for operating systems research. Research can quickly boot up and test OSes in development without having to restart hardware.

Virtualization also provides affordable support for legacy operating systems. Applications that need to run on older OSes no longer need a physical box dedicated just to them. They can run as one VM of many, sharing the physical resource with other applications.
