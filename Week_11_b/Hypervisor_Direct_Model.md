## Approach
- In theÂ **hypervisor-direct model**, the hypervisor intercepts every device access request that is performed by the guest VM. 
- The hypervisor no longer has the constraint that the requested device and the physical device match.

- Instead, the hypervisor can translate the device access request to some generic representation of an I/O operation for that particular family of devices - network or disk, for example - and then traverse the hypervisor resident I/O stack. The bottom of that stack is the actual real device driver, which the hypervisor will finally invoke to fulfill the request.

## Pros 
A key benefit of this approach is that the VM remains decoupled from the physical platform/device. As a result, migration remains easy. In addition, device sharing can now occur since device access is managed by the hypervisor.

## Cons 

The downside of the model is that the device emulation step adds latency to device accesses. As well, this model requires that the hypervisor supports all of the drivers so it can perform the necessary emulations, which means that the hypervisor is now exposed to all of the complexities and complications of various device drivers.
